DESCRIPTION:

Olympia simulates a real world theatre without the use of hardware. This program has you upload a video (ex. theatre) while controlling lights, sound, special effects, supertitles, mechanical effects, and cues. This program helps the stage crew easily make changes without physically making adjustments but by using the controls of our program.
